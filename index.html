        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I am a full stack developer with a passion for UX and design.  My love for coding comes from enjoying solving problems and seeing the ideas and entire process come to life.  I am passionate about Javascript and modern Javascript libraries, and I love using CSS as a tool to create a responsive website, clever animations, and a minimalist design to convey more.</p>

          <p>My interest in software has led me to build things such as a Front End project, and most recently a full stack project using technologies including React and Node.  When I'm not coding, I am often going on a run, playing the guitar, or going on a challenging hike.  I am lifelong learner and I am always excited for a new challenge and the opportunity to learn something new.</p>

        <h2>Marvel Encyclopedia</h2>
        <a href="https://marvel-encyclopedia.netlify.com/" target="_blank">View Live Site</a>
        <p>Marvel films and television shows are being released more than ever, with more new fans on the rise. However, not every fan has 
          read the comics and understands who each character is. Therefore, I wanted to create an application that makes it easier for 
          users to search for and learn about Marvel characters quickly.  This application allows users to search for their favorite 
          Marvel characters. From there, users learn who they are, what comic books they were in, what events & crossovers they were in, 
          and can save which comic books they've read or want to read in the future.

        <h2>Sleeplogger</h2>
        <a href="https://evening-tundra-36241.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">View Live Site</a>
        <p>An application that keeps track of how much you slept and how your sleep was. Users can fill out how many hours they 
          slept, answer a simple multiple choice question regarding how they felt when they woke up, and add any additional details 
          about how their sleep was.
