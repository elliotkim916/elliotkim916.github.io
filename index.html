      <section class="bio">
          <p>I am a full stack developer with a passion for UX and design.  My love for coding comes from enjoying solving problems and seeing the ideas and entire process come to life.  I am passionate about Javascript and modern Javascript libraries, and I love using CSS as a tool to create a responsive website, clever animations, and a minimalist design to convey more.</p>

          <p>My interest in software has led me to build things such as a Front End project, and most recently a full stack project using technologies including React and Node.  When I'm not coding, I am often going on a run, playing the guitar, or going on a challenging hike.  I am lifelong learner and I am always excited for a new challenge and the opportunity to learn something new.</p>
